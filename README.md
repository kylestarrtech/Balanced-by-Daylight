# The Dead by Daylight Balance Checker
### This is a tool designed to assist competitive Dead by Daylight players in making balancing for tournament leagues, and making sure team builds remain compliant to said balancing.

This tool is in very early stages, but I decided to make the repository public nonetheless.

## Reporting Issues

Spot an issue? Feel free to create a new Issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/kylestarrtech/DBD-Balance-Checker/issues) section of the GitHub! Another option if you'd like to contribute is to fork the codebase and try to patch it!

## Installation

Installing and running this codebase is quite easy. A Node.js version of 18 or above is recommended, but I'm confident older versions will work just fine (18 just happens to be the version I'm using for this).

Here are the steps:
1. You must have Node.js installed and ready for this. You can do that by following this guide [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
2. Clone the GitHub repository through your method of choice (CLI, GUI, .etc).
3. Use the command in your terminal `npm i` to install all of the node packages required.
4. Use `node server.js` to run it, or configure with your favourite live-server application of choice (I used nodemon for the development of this).
5. The server is now running! You should be able to connect to `http://localhost:3000/` and see the project active!
